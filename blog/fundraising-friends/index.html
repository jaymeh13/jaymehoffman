  <h1>Fundraising Friends</h1>

    <p>Last week, I told a friend my favorite fundraising advice: "Make fundraising friends."</p>

    <p>Startup founders often treat fundraising as a solo sport. They guess when to raise money, how much, and how to go about it. They craft their pitch in isolation and reach out cold to investors, which leads to wasted time, ignored emails, and missed opportunities.</p>

    <p>Fundraising, when done right, is a team sport.</p>

    <p>You learn the market conditions from other founders and investors. You get feedback on your pitch, investor leads, warm intros, and recommendations on investors as potential partners. You vent to trusted founders who remind you that the struggle is normal. You negotiate and close with support from your fundraising friends, investors, and lawyers. Almost nothing in fundraising is truly solo.</p>

    <p>I always tell founders to lean into this team aspect of fundraising. Make "fundraising friends." At any given time, there are always founders raising or who have just finished. Find them. Create a group.</p>

    <p>Being part of a small group of founders fundraising at the same time is one of the best things you can do. Your pitch will improve, you'll 10x your investor pipeline, and you'll feel less alone during one of the hardest parts of building a company.</p>

    <p>Here are some additional fundraising links I frequently share.</p>
