* I started working on Eons, [a side project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WxDHDHwCDBdD9vM2Q3GiN_bcpyeuK3WcUPPMNuLMuI4/edit?usp=sharing) that helps people set and track their long-term goals into different periods and cateogires. 
* Network effects are responsible for 70% of the value created by tech companies since the Internet became a thing in 1994 🤯 - Here are my [favorite posts on Network Effects](https://jaymehoffman.com/network-effects/).
* An Idea is a starting point - not a blueprint, but a question. If an idea is a blueprint, it has to be right. If an idea is a question, it can be wrong, so long as it's wrong in a way that leads to more ideas. [PG](http://paulgraham.com/ideas.html)
* [Four characteristics of a dreamy business](https://twitter.com/jaymehoffman/status/1040989026612928512): 1. Customer love 2. [Scale very large](https://stratechery.com/aggregation-theory/) 3. Strong returns on capital 4. Durable – won’t change
* We’re taking the next 3 months off from actively trying to start a business. It feels like we’re putting the cart before the horse. We want to start a business but… we don’t have an idea. Most of our ideas are pretty lame and it feels like we’re forcing it. We should start a business to pursue an idea and not the other way around. 
* We re-launched [Keyboardgym as a website](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Keyboardgym-MVP2--AM3w_a62PFlBkOT7E91c~BmSAg-1oImxpdGIU3HbjCqdNqYz) on Product Hunt, Hacker News and to over 200 people that favorited the repository on Github. Not a single person was interested in the solution. I’m glad we tested our assumption. The big lesson here is to test assumptions faster. We could’ve shipped something weeks if not months earlier and learned people are not interested in this.
* [KW announced the consumer app I’m working on.](https://www.inman.com/2018/09/05/keller-williams-acquires-app-startup-smarteragent-to-compete-with-zillow-redfin/) This is a testament to my restlessness - I’m leading the largest part of one of the largest consumer tech initiatives… and I'm more determined than ever to start and build a big business. 
* We re-explored the idea of creating Headspace for carpal tunnel, gamer’s thumb and other repetitive strain injuries. We created a  [deck and product plan](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ootsVv4IRzM12FZZ8sTZ_FnzqSK8JEPd2RPt8_Us310/edit#slide=id.p) to flesh out the idea.
